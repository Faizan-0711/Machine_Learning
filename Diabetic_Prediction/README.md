# Built a Diabetic Prediction model using Machine Learning.
Used :-
1. Pyhton
2. Jupyter notebook
3. Support Vector Machine (SVC)

## Data File :
diabetes.csv

## Process :
Importing the Dependencies -> Data Pre-processing -> Spliting the train and test model -> Standardizing the data -> Building the prediction model -> Checking the Accuracy score.

## Accuracy Score :
1. On training dataset - 79%
2. On test dataset - 75%

## Model :
DiabeticDetectionModel

(Note :The model must be feeded with the Standardize data to predict the outcome CORRECTLY as it is trained with the standard form of data.)
